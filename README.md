# DATAMINING-SSVEP-CCA-RQA-CAFFEINE 

The archived codes are of my Masters of Technology Thesis research work titled, "Data mining based approach to study the effect of caffeinated coffee on SSVEP brain signals" Please refer to https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2019.103526 to review my complete work.

-------
GLOSSARY
-------

SSVEP: Steady state visual evoked potentials (observed in EEG recordings with photic stimulus)

CCA: Canonical correlation analysis

RQA: Recurrence quantification analysis

CAFFEINE: Data mining carried out with caffeinated and non-caffeinated SSVEP signals of 7 different frequencies.

-------

DATASET: 22 x 5120 x 6 x 7 (array)

  22: Number of EEG channels
  
  5120: Number of sample points in each EEG channel
  
  6: Number of volunteers
  
  7: Number of differnt photic stimulus used to capture SSVEP signals
