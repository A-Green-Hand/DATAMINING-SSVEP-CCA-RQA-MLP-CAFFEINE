# SSVEP_CCA_RQA_CAFFEINE 

The codes are part of my Masters of Technology Thesis research work "Data mining based approach to study the effect of caffeinated coffee on SSVEP brain signals https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2019.103526"

SSVEP: Steady state visual evoked potentials (observed in EEG recordings with photic stimulus)

CCA: Canonical correlation analysis

RQA: Recurrence quantification analysis

Caffeine: Data mining carried out with caffeinated and non-caffeinated SSVEP signals of 7 different frequencies.


Dataset: 22 x 5120 x 6 x 7 (array)

  22: Number of EEG channels
  
  5120: Number of sample points in each EEG channel
  
  6: Number of volunteers
  
  7: Number of differnt photic stimulus used to capture SSVEP signals
